# ✨ Welcome to Dream App!

You're all set up! Your app is ready to build.

## Get Started (Three Quick Steps!)

### 1. Enable the Browser Tab

In the chat window (bottom right), click the **🌐 Globe icon** at the top, then click **"Browser"** to enable it.

This lets the AI see your app as you build it!

### 2. Press `Cmd + L` (or `Ctrl + L` on Windows)

This opens your AI assistant.

### 3. Say this:

```
Show me my app in the browser
```

or

```
Open http://localhost:3000 in the browser
```

**That's it!** Your assistant will open your app and help you build whatever you want.

> 💡 **Pro tip:** Your dev server is already running! Look at the bottom panel to see it.

## What You Can Build

Just describe what you want in plain English:

**Examples:**
- "Add a page where users can create notes"
- "Make the homepage more colorful"
- "Add a profile page with user settings"
- "Create a todo list"
- "Add dark mode"

Your assistant will build it, test it, and show you it working.

## Need Help?

Just ask your assistant:
- "What can I build?"
- "Show me some examples"
- "I have an idea but not sure how to describe it"

**Ready? Press `Cmd + L` and say "Get started"** 🚀
